### Hi there I'm Calum ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring frontend developer, minimalist, and coffee enjoyer.

To date I have been working through the DfE skills for life bootcamp provider by HyperionDev.

Over the course of the bootcamp I have got to learn some core frontend technologies, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & React.
Here is a link to the final capstone project of teh bootcamp, a hangman game created in react and styled with Bootstrap:
