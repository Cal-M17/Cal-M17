### Hi there I'm Calum ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring frontend developer, minimalist, and coffee enjoyer.

I started my coding journey back in 2020 during one of the many COVID lockdowns. My focus was on attempting to build apps that I had a personal use for and in January 2021 I released my first app to the google play store. It was an app that would play a variety of ambient sounds that you could listen to as background noise. Work however picked up again and a change in role meant I had less time to develop this app further than its initial release.

The idea of building apps had stayed with me â€“ not necessarily discrete mobile apps, but web apps as well â€“ and in October 2022, I discovered the skills for life training scheme ran by the Department for Education. Knowing that this is what I would like to do for a career, and that I would need some accountability to keep my learning on track, I enrolled in the Web Development bootcamp provided by HyperionDev. And after many late nights and longer weekends, I managed to submit all the tasks and required for completion.

Since the bootcamp, I have grown as a developer, further developing the tasks submitted to give them a bit more originality and functionality. 

Here is a link to the final capstone project of the bootcamp, a hangman game created in React and styled with Bootstrap:
